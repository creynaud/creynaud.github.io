Hi, my name is Claire. I develop iPhone and iPad apps as a freelance. I craft apps that take advantage of the cloud. I work from Saint-Etienne or Lyon, in France. Above all I like to build software that brings value to its users. I am also a big fan of the Lean Start-up methodology.

## Experience

### 2014-now, iOS and Django freelance developer at Claire Reynaud EIRL

I am a freelance applications developer. I craft mobile apps for iOS. I have 4 apps that are published on the App Store: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/claire-reynaud/id799355423][itunes]. My Willio app, that lets you split bills between friends, has been number 1 top paid app in the Finance category in France during a good part of the summer 2014. My apps got 100K downloads this year.

I also do a little bit of web development with the Django web framework, but I mainly do back-end and REST services development (still with Django). I run these services on Heroku, a Platform As A Service provider.

I have also been working on an online translation service called BabelBytes. On BabelBytes, iPhone app developers can get their app translated to other languages. The BabelBytes team was selected to participate to the final phase of the [International Create Challenge 2013][2] in Switzerland. The International Create Challenge is a 3-week immersive accelerator program that gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to drive their projects to a Minimum Viable Product.

### 2011-2013, Mobile and Django software engineer at Epyx

I was working as a senior software engineer at [Epyx][3], a Swiss company providing cloud-ready mobile services to the enterprise market. I was contributing to SAAS products (exopoint and exodoc) and to custom application developments for Epyx customers.

I was doing mainly Django and web development during my second year at Epyx, but depending on the priorities I was also working on the native iOS and Android apps.

During my first year at Epyx, I did mainly iOS development, but I also contributed to the Android app code base. I investigated unit testing solutions to put in place some tests with mocks and code coverage for both Android and iOS platforms. I also worked on putting in place some UI tests, with the Calabash framework. I set up a Jenkins continuous integration server. Still on the mobile side, I implemented the Epyx synchronization library that enables an Android or iOS application to replicate JSON documents from the server to a mobile application. Documents can be updated offline.

Here are the apps I contributed to when I was working at Epyx: [https://itunes.apple.com/ch/artist/epyx/id467805432][4]

### 2009-2011, Mobile Virtualization Platform engineer at VMware

I took part in the creation of the [VMWare][5] Mobile Infrastructure. This infrastructure is a JEE/Android stack that allows a corporate IT group to provision, manage and update corporate virtual machines on employee owned mobile devices.

I played a major role in the bootstrap of the project, especially regarding the web application for mobile virtual machines administration. I put in place the GWT web UI, as well as the REST services and Spring MVC, down to the JPA/Hibernate persistence layer. I worked on all the tiers of this stack. I also worked on the Android application that communicates with the server infrastructure to install, update and apply policies on the virtual machine.

During my 2 years at VMWare, I have been working with a team in Boston (MA, USA) on a daily basis.

### 2006-2008, SDK engineer at Trango Virtual Processors

I created the Trango Eclipse plug-in for Trango Virtual Processors, a mobile virtualization company acquired in 2008 by VMWare. With the Trango Eclipse plug-in, the Trango virtual machine developers could write, deploy, monitor and debug Trango virtual machines on devices. I was also on the customer field by leading evaluation projects, responding to support requests and contributing to the Trango SDK documentation.

### End of 2005, JEE engineer at Kelkoo

I took part in the Cars project at [Kelkoo][6], at that time a [Yahoo][7] company. I contributed to their JEE back-end.
