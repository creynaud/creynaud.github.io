I have been an iOS developer for 3 years now, but 2014 was the first year I published an app in my own name on the App Store.

Two of my apps got more than 35K downloads each. Another one made it to 1st paid app in the Finance category in France, and stayed there for the greatest part of the summer. The last one only got a few downloads, I guess it did not interest anyone.

I got 200 support requests via email since I published my first app in January. I answered every single email I got. And here is what happened.

First, the great majority of users who got an answer were surprised and delighted that I took the time to answer their request. From what they said, this is pretty unusual to get an answer when you send a support request on the App Store.

Second, even when I *really* screwed up (I published an app that was not working at all :(), and users were sending me harsh messages, they ended up being happy that I answered and fixed things quickly.

Sometimes users are asking for new features or tweaks. Again, I answered every email asking for new stuff, even if it was to say "No I don't plan to do it".

My takeaway from this is that you should always answer support requests. This sounds obvious. But from what my users say, it is not obvious to everyone who is crafting apps out there. Answering support requests will always end up making up your day. Here is an answer I got from a user of my BusyBox time tracking app. He had asked for a small tweak into the .csv file that exports your activity data. I ended up doing the change 2 months later. I hesitated to send him a follow up email, because I was like "It took me so damn long to ship this, I am sure he switched to another app by now". And here is what his answer was:

"Thank you !! This is the first time I have received a response - and an action - from a software or hardware producer. The best to you, and I will write a review for BusyBox."

This totally made my day <3!

So are you answering every support email that you get from your app users? If you do, then, good job :)! If you don't, then get started, because good things are going to happen to you.
